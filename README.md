# üìå Smart Attendance System Using Custom Facial Recognition

## üìñ Description
This project aims to develop a **robust and efficient Smart Attendance System** leveraging a novel deep learning approach for **accurate, real-time facial recognition** in dynamic, real-world conditions. Traditional attendance methods are inefficient and error-prone, while existing facial recognition models struggle with lighting variability, occlusions (e.g., masks, glasses), and scalability. This system addresses these challenges by designing a custom hybrid CNN-RNN architecture tailored specifically for attendance tracking in diverse environments.

## üéØ Objectives
- Design and implement a **custom hybrid CNN-RNN architecture** for facial recognition.
- Integrate **adaptive preprocessing techniques** to handle lighting and occlusion challenges.
- Develop a **modular embedding layer** for domain-specific fine-tuning.
- Create a **real-time video processing system** for attendance tracking.
- Build an **intuitive web-based interface** for monitoring and reporting attendance.
- Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance in diverse scenarios using comprehensive metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and inference latency.

## üß† Background
Traditional attendance systems (manual roll calls, ID swipes) are time-consuming and prone to fraud and errors. Facial recognition offers automation but current pretrained models (e.g., VGGFace, ResNet) lack robustness in real-world conditions due to:
- Dynamic lighting conditions affecting facial visibility.
- Occlusions like masks and glasses causing misidentifications.
- Scalability issues with large datasets and real-time video feeds.

This project leverages advances in AI and computer vision to overcome these limitations by combining spatial and temporal analysis through a hybrid CNN-RNN model, adaptive image preprocessing, and active learning.

## üß™ Methodology

### 5.1 Data Collection
- Capture diverse facial images and videos under varying lighting and occlusion conditions.
- Use a combination of public datasets and dynamically collected video feeds.

### 5.2 Data Analysis
- Preprocess images with adaptive contrast and illumination correction.
- Analyze feature embeddings to optimize recognition accuracy.

### 5.3 Model Design
- Develop a custom hybrid CNN-RNN architecture to extract spatial and temporal features.
- Implement custom loss functions to reduce false negatives in group and occlusion scenarios.
- Use Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.
- Integrate backend services with Flask or Django frameworks.

### 5.4 Model Evaluation
- Evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, and inference latency.
- Validate on cross-domain datasets under varied real-world conditions.

### 5.5 System Workflow
- Real-time video feed ‚Üí Adaptive preprocessing ‚Üí CNN-RNN model ‚Üí Attendance logging ‚Üí Web-based monitoring interface.
